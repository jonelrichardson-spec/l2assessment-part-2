# Customer Inbox Triage App

## Overview

The Customer Inbox Triage app is a lightweight AI-powered tool that helps classify customer support messages and recommend actions. It uses Google Gemini AI to categorize messages, applies rule-based urgency scoring, and suggests next steps based on predefined templates.

## Problem Statement

Support teams waste time manually reading and triaging customer messages. This tool provides an automated first pass at classification to help prioritize and route messages more efficiently.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **AI**: Google Gemini API (Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental)
- **Runtime**: Browser-based (local development only)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Google Gemini API key (FREE - get from https://aistudio.google.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd "L2 assessment"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Google Gemini API Key**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Edit `.env.local` and add your Google Gemini API key:
   ```
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-actual-key-here
   ```

   Get your FREE API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/

   **Why Google Gemini?** Google Gemini offers a generous free tier with fast inference and no credit card required!

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## How It Works

1. **Paste Message**: User pastes a customer support message into the text area
2. **Analyze**: Click "Analyze Message" to process the input
3. **Classification**: The app runs three processes in parallel:
   - **Category Classification** (LLM): Uses Google Gemini (Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental) to categorize the message
   - **Urgency Scoring** (Rule-based): Applies simple rules to determine urgency
   - **Recommendation** (Template-based): Maps category to a recommended action
4. **Display Results**: Shows category, urgency tag, recommended action, and AI reasoning
5. **History**: All analyses are saved to localStorage and viewable in the History tab
